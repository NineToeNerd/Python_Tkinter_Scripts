# Python_Tkinter_Scripts
Scripts (one .py file per script) that use Tkinter with Python

The tictactoe_revised.py file is a new (way better) version of the original tictactoe.py file.
I created tictactoe.py in my first year of college, when I first learned how to code, first learned Python, and
learned about Tkinter. That's why it is a bad example of programming, but I still like to have it because it is
the first game I ever programmed.
